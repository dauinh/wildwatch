This predator has now been eliminated by the predatory New Guinea Flatworm (<em>Platydemus manokwari</em>), which also preys on <em>Partula</em> species. Invasive ants may also have some impacts. Habitat loss has contributed to declines on several islands. This has been due to development in some areas, but particularly to browsing by introduced goats and cattle.

This species has suffered major population and range declines in recent decades. Currently, it is threatened by invasive species and habitat loss. It was widespread and abundant in the early 20th century, but had declined by 1989. On Guam only one population survives, as is the case on Saipan. It is already extinct on Aguiguan, but its range has expanded on Sarigan due to habitat recovery following ungulate removal in 2000. On Pagan island a substantial population exists on the south of the island but is now potentially threatened by designation of the island as a live-fire site for military exercises.
